## Project information

### Description
Approximately **46%** of the population in India is suffering from water pollution. That's why we aim to enhance accessibility to clean water and promote better water management in India.

### Development period
* 2023.05.16 ∼ 2023.07.31

## Key features
* **Provision of Regional Water Quality Data** - Collect water quality-related data by connecting sensors to a Raspberry Pi. Provide water quality data corresponding to the user's location. Specifically, We monitor water temperature, pH, turbidity and water level based on the collected data.
* **Automatic Data Updates** - It is a structure where data is automatically updated after a specific period of time. We develop a map that allows users to easily view the updated status of water resources.
* **Alarm System** - We assess the state of water based on water quality data. When a dangerous situation occurs, we send a notification to the user within 10 milliseconds. This enables users to receive immediate information about the water condition and take necessary measures in response.
