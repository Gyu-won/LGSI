                    PURESOME measures the overall water contamination by monitoring factors such as temperature, 
                    l, pH and water level. It utilizes the usersâ€™ location information to determine whether clean water is available in ther vicinity and provides alerts through notification to inform them about the availability of clean water.

                <p>
                    If your location has changed, you can update it by accessing the MyPage section and updating your location information. Once you update your location, it will be changed to the new one.

                    We're constantly working to ensure strong security, protect your privacy, and make PURESOME even more effective and efficient for you. We built easy-to-use privacy and security tools like 2-step verification. So when it comes to the information you share with PURESOME, you're in control.

            <div class = "content">
                <p>
                    Each PURESOME storage system from which data gets deleted has its own detailed process for safe and complete deletion. This might involve repeated passes through the system to confirm all data has been deleted, or breif delays to allow for recovery from mistakes. As a result, deletion could sometimes take longer when extra time is needed to safely and completely delete the data.
